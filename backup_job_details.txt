This sql can list backup job details, ie when the job started and finished.
 
 
SELECT session_key,
       input_type,
       status,
       To_char(start_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss') AS start_time,
       To_char(end_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss')   AS end_time,
       Round(( elapsed_seconds / 3600 ), 5)         AS hours,
       time_taken_display                           AS time_taken
FROM   v$rman_backup_job_details
ORDER  BY session_key; 
 
 
This can be useful with rman backup and the command:
 
2> set until time = "to_date('15/05/2012 13:30:00','dd/mm/yyyy hh24:mi:ss')";
 
The sql query above can be used to show when the job completed and thus what value to to place in the “set until time” line.
